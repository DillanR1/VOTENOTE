# VoteNote || General Assembly Hackathon Winning Project

# Hackathon 

The hackathon was a three day event for recent Software Engineering Immersive Grads and UX / UI Design Grads to collaborate on a project that would be presented before a panel of judges. 

The prompt was to build something that could be useful to voters in the upcoming elections, whether it be local or primary. The app could not favor one party over another and needed to be readily accessible to voters of ALL backgrounds.

# Usage 

VoteNote is an application built for fast and immediate access to California state propositions and ballot measures. There is no log in, no mess, no fuss. Enter Your zip code and preferred language* to get started. The propositions are able to be individually clicked from the left-hand side selector**. Feel free to go in order or jump around. 

Each Prop will list fact-based, hypothesized implications of selecting "Yes" or "No" for each prop. There is no political bias here, as the app is built to be accessible to ALL voters.

Once selecting "Yes" or "No" on a proposition, your selection will be saved to your VoteNote for future use. You can view your selections at any time by selecting the "View Your VoteNote" button in the top left corner. 

Once you are done, select the "Looks Good" button on the "View Your VoteNote" page and your personal VoteNote button will be sent to your email***

# Special Notes and Considerations

*Zip code and preferred language are for future updates there was not enough time to integrate all desired features in the alloted time.
*VoteNote will currently take any 5 digit zip code and the default language is English.
** The selector starts at 14 and ends at 25. This is done for demonstration purposes. The full measures are not integrated into the app.
*** The "looks good" button will not send an email at this time. The app does need some maintenance, but the basic features remain intact.
